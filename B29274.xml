         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:206382:3"/>
            <p>Oh my Deare, and eternall beloved Friends, and fellow Citizens, a people saved by the Lord; and known to him, of all the families of the earth, who is like unto you? how amiable is your habitation, and how pleasant is your dwelling place? how delightfull is it to meet with you in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which God hath pitched amongst you, even as Lillies among Thornes, are you set before me, who are found walking in the truth, and faithfull to the Lord, and as fruitfull Trees, among the Trees of the Forrest, faire, and fresh, greene, and lively; yea verily in the light of life doe I behold you, in the beloved, as vessels of honour, sanctified, and made meet for the Masters use, although you were taken out of the same Lump, and hewed from the same Rock, and of the same earth, bloud, and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, that they are of, who yet remaine vessels of wrath, in the unconverted estate, separated from the Lord as reprobate Silver.</p>
            <p>Surely, the Lord whom you have sought, and for whom you have waited, hath done great things for you, yea, mighty things hath his right hand brought to passe, amongst you, glory to his name for evermore: My beloved and longed for in the Lord, let the high, holy, and honourable call of God, which hath reached unto you be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you, with pure obedience, and his loving kindnesse with faithfullnesse, let his manifold mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be had in an everlasting remembrance, and declare his noble Acts unto your children, that they may tell it to another Generation, that so in Ages to come, you may manifestly be declared to

And Friends, in as much as you have many dayes and months past, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the new and living way, and now in an acceptable time, as an answer to your earnest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, the Lord hath administred an entrance into it, let his free love constraine you all to walk in it as obedient children, that your light may shine forth as the light of seaven dayes, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment of the adversaries of the Lord, and the stopping of all slanderous mouthes, whose pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is to blaspheme God, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven; for the Lord is risen in glory, and in great Majesty, to shake all Nations, and to staine the glory of all flesh, to assemble the outcasts of <hi>Israel,</hi> to comfort the mourners in <hi>Sion,</hi> and to proclaime liberty to the Captives, who hath shewed you the path of life, and guided your feet into the way of peace, who is giving beautifull garments instead of ashes, even the garment of praise, for the spirit of heavinesse; yea, I bear you record, your light is come, and the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, is arising among you, and upon you, in the day of the visitation of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting love; and this one thing the Lord requires of you, that is, to obey his Voyce, and the way to manifest your obedience, is to walk humbly with him, in a holy life, and in a chast conversation, in your place and callings, according to your measure
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206382:4"/>of the free gift of God communicated unto you, and manifested in you to profit withall; and that you may be filled, with the spirit of wisdome, and furnished with the heavenly treasure, unto every good word and worke, my hearts desire and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for you all is that, Grace, Mercy, Truth, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Love, everlasting Righteousnesse; and perfect Peace, may be abundantly multiplyed, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in you, and among you all, that you may be made compleat in him, who is the head of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall body, the Church or houshold of faith, which is builded of living stones, upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of many Generations, for an habitation of God through the Spirit, that in you he may dwell, and be glorified, and over you he may rejoyce, as the operation and workmanship of his own hands, who is creating you againe in Christ Jesus unto good workes, which he hath before time ordained that we should walk in them.</p>
            <p>These things my Friends I write unto you, as moved of the Lord, for the stirring up of the pure mind in you, who knowes the truth and are made partakers of the pure and precious faith which was once delivered to the Saints; and hereby I doe as your servant for Christs sake, and in Christ stead, exhort and beseech you all to attend, and condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the counsell of the Lord, directed unto you through him that hath loved and doth love you unfeignedly, as being not only neerly related, but also inseperably united unto you, as a member of the same body, whereof Christ Jesus is the head, in whose behalfe these necessary things are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206382:4"/>brought before you, by way of remembrance, not as if you were ignorant of them, but because you know them already, and other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid; and if any beast or false prophet, out of the Sea, or out of the earth, nay if an Angell inlightened from Heaven, should bring any other doctrine, or preach any other Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel among you, then that which hath been freely preached, and by you received, in which you stand, let him be accursed, and receive none such into your houses, neither bid them God speed, least you partake with them in their evill deeds: And Beloved, believe not every spirit, for some deceitfull spirits may fall in among you, whose wickednesse is more spirituall, and their iniquity more malicious, then formerly hath appeared, though many of the like spirit, and principle, hath been denyed, and declared against, and turned away from, by some of you, that have known the Depthes and Wiles of Sathan, who letteth and will let untill he be taken out of the way, who is now revealed, and made manifest, that he may be destroyed, and cast out, as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser of the Brethren, and an enemy of their peace.</p>
            <p>Truly Friends, My heart is inlarged towards you, and my love abounds to you, more then herein can be expressed, or contained, let me be read by you where I am written without hands, and let this be received, as the flowing forth of one streame from the Fountaine; In the fear of the Lord, I write unto you who are called to be Saints,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206382:5"/>both to the Ancient, and Honourable, Male, and Female, in the houshould of Faith, in bonds, and at Liberty.</p>
            <p>Fathers and Mothers, in love, feare, wisdome, and moderation, rule, reprove, informe, instruct, correct, and counsell your Children, and according to their growth and knowledge in the truth, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister unto them, for their edification, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and let not your own wills, or, a zeale, before true knowledge, usurp authority over them, because they are the fruit of your body, but look upon them who are begotten of God, and have received the truth, as upon the off-spring of God, and equall with you, as in that relation; and if they be such as have chosen the better part, and are made truly wise unto salvation, despise not their youth, but be ready to receive instruction, or information from them, as well as to administer to them; and if they be such as be out of the truth, provoke them not to wrath, but by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, labour in wisdome and moderation, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to love, and to good workes, that if peradventure you may be a means to gaine them, to the acknowledgment of the truth, in which you have believed, so will your renowne go forth amongst the Heathen round about, and the Lord will multiply and increase your off-spring, and cause them to break forth on the right hand and on the left, to build the old wast places, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the desolate heritages, and herein the Lord will be glorified in you, and by you, and if you abide faithfull to him, he will make you an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206382:5"/>excellency, even the joy of many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Crowne you with the first dominion, who first beleeved in the truth, and whom God hath set as the first fruits of his creatures in this Generation.</p>
            <p>Likewise all ye Children of the Light, who have received the truth in the love of it, let Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Obedience, be manifested to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the Lord, and for his sake submit to them in things pertaining to this life, in singlenesse of heart, and receive their counsell with meeknesse of spirit, and readinesse of mind, when they speak according to the Word of God, and mind of Christ, that the precious Promises of God you may receive, both length of dayes, and peace in your dwellings, the blessing and presence of God, both in your going forth, and in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, so shall you be for ever established in the Truth, and everlasting Righteousnesse, and the Lord will give you a name in his house, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Walls, better then that of Sons and Daughters, if you continue faithfull unto the end.</p>
            <p>And you that are Husbands love your Wives, who are joyned unto you, and given as meet helpes for you, and watch over them for good, to instruct, cherish, comfort, confirme, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish them in the truth, that you may both come to be joyned, and everlastingly betrothed to one Head and Husband in the Spirit and in the Truth, that here your union may encrease, and your off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring may become holy to the Lord, who saw
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206382:6"/>that it was not good for man to be alone, and therefore gave him the help of another, who is no more two but one, being joyned in and by the Lord, which thing by some of you is witnessed, according to measure.</p>
            <p>And Wives submit your selves to your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, in the fear of the Lord, as head over you, to order, guide, and counsell, comfort, and direct, and in all wisdome, meeknesse, and moderation, as meet helps and faithfull yoak-fellowes, behave your selves towards them, so will you have praise of men, and favour with God; for the ornament of a meek spirit, is the garment of praises, and let your adorning be after the manner, and according to the example of the holy and honourable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in the dayes of old, and this is a thing of good report, which may stand recorded for ages to come, that the children yet unborne may hear of your Renowne, and come to the brightnesse of your rising.</p>
            <p>Likewise you that are Masters of Servants, and Rulers in Families, be not hasty, nor high minded, but in the spirit of meeknesse, rule in love, and in the fear of God, in the authority of Christ, as his Servants, and not as Lords over Gods heritage, for he that rules amongst men, must be just, ruling in the fear and wisdome of God, and by this meanes the Lord will bow the spirits of your servants, in subjection to the power of God, when his Law and Government thus comes to be set up in you, to order and rule your houses well, so will the Lord honour you in the sight of men, and blesse you in all that you put your hands unto.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:206382:6"/>
            <p>And let as many Servants, and handmaids as are under the yoak, be subject unto their own Masters, to whom they are related by any outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, contract, or engagement whatsoever, serving them with a ready mind, in singlenesse of heart, not with respect to their persons as men pleasers, and eye servants, but as servants of Christ, and subject to men in the thing that is good, for his sake; And hereby will the Lord be honoured, and his Truth be spread abroad in the earth, so will his Doctrine be adorned, and your light will goe forth as the Morning, and your Salvation, as a Lampe that burneth.</p>
            <p>And all you Prisoners of hope, for the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jesus, be still, and waite upon the Lord in patience, all the dayes of your appointed time, for the Lords love is unto you, and your cause is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, who will arise for your Redemption, and returne your Captivity, as the streains in the South, and plead with your adversaries face to face, for all the hard measure you have received from their hands, which are full of blood: I am as a companion with you to this day, as one bound with you, being a member of the same body which the Lord hath prepared to fulfill his will, both by doing, and suffering; And so unto the Protection of Israels keeper, I commit you all; and as a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the love of God, let these lines be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and read, amongst you, which are written in bowells of love and tendernesse, by your Friend in the Truth, and a servant unto you, for and in the behalf of Jesus Christ our Head.</p>

            <p>DEare and precious souls, for as much as it hath pleased the infinite wise God, who is pure for ever, and just, and equall in all his wayes, who loves Truth and delights therein, who is strong, and mighty to deliver, and able to save from sin and Sathan, bondage, and corruption, all who comes unto him, and waites upon him, in truth and meeknesse, and sincerity of heart, who is the God of the spirits of all flesh, who gives life and breath unto all, who made the World and all things therein by his power, and by his Word which is powerfull upholds all things at this day and time, who is the same to day as ever, in Power and Majesty, his Arme is not shortned that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not save, nor his Eye closed that it cannot see, neither is his Mouth shut that it cannot speak, but he lives, and workes, and speaks, and sees, and discernes what is contrived and acted among the Sons and Daughters of men; his living Word abides for ever, and is as quick, and as lively as

            <p>Now seeing Dearly Beloved, that it hath pleased our gracious Almighty God, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in these last times according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise declared by his holy Prophets, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great love in pouring forth of his holy Spirit upon his people, and to gather them from off the barren Mountains, and from the

            <p>Deare Friends, as the Lord in his rich love hath visited you, and by his grace called you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:206382:8"/>out of darknesse into his marvelous light, so, deare ones, prize his love, and walke worthy of that high and heavenly calling whereunto the Lord hath called you, pleasing him in all things, waiting in the light which is pure, (which is of Christ) in you, that ye all may receive, wisdome, and counsell from God, that whatsoever ye doe or take in hand, may be done to the glory and praise of him, that hath called you.</p>
            <p>Remember and alwayes keep in mind the goodnesse of the Lord, and let his Word dwell and abide in you, lay it up in your hearts, as a precious and holy treasure, so will ye be kept in a lively sensible state, apt, and fit to receive instruction from the Lord; The living word seasons and keeps the heart sweet and savoury, so that corruption cannot grow there, neither any other lusts, or bad thing, but by the Word it is cut down and destroyed, blessed are they that keep the Word of God in them, such shall be kept in peace and unity, with God, in the light, and there every one shall see the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable calling unto which ye are called, he that calls is holy and honourable, and the calling unto which you are called is likewise holy and honourable, considering what ye are called from, and what ye are called unto, formerly ye walked in darknesse, and had fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darknesse, now ye are called out of darknesse to walke in the light, and there to have communion one with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:206382:9"/>another, and fellowship with God, who is light, and with his son Jesus Christ, who likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himselfe to be the light of the world, in the light is the precious unity, with God, and with Christ, and one with another. <hi>If we walke in the light,</hi> (saith the beloved Disciple) <hi>as he is in the light, then</hi> (not till then) <hi>have we fellowship one with another, and the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</hi> They that love the light, and believe in the light, and walke in the light, such receive remission of sins, such worship God truly, such are of one heart, and of one mind, and soul, such only are accepted of the Lord, and with, and to such is my soul for ever united, and bound up in the Covenant of light, life, and peace: And unto you all who are lovers, and followers of the light, is my heart poured forth in love towards you.</p>
            <p>And now deare souls, as you have been called to such an high and heavenly calling, mind eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one your particular duties, in walking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the Lord in every thing, that good order may be kept amongst you, both in your meetings and solemne Assemblies, in your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worship of God, and also in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon occasions and affaires amongst men; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is upon my spirit to write unto you at this time, concerning these two weighty things.</p>
            <p>And first, Concerning the Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God: That which God requires of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206382:9"/>one, is Justice, Mercy, and a humble, and orderly conversation, for as it is the love of God by his light to shew you his will and mind, so it is your duties to doe the Will of God, which Will is your Sanctification, and as it was the manner and practice of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, (who were called in the light) to meet together to waite upon God, and to speake one to another, as the Spirit of Truth did move and give them utterance, for the strengthening one another, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up one another in the most holy faith; so it is now judged meet, and good, also use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and necessary, for all who are called to be Saints, to meet often together, to waite upon the Lord, that their strength may be renewed: So Friends, when ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to waite upon God, come orderly in the feare of the Lord, the first that enters into the place of your meetings, be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, nor wander up and downe, either in body or mind, but innocently set downe in some place, and turne in thy mind to the light, and waite upon God singly, as if none were present but the Lord, and here thou art strong; then the next that comes in let them innocently and in sincerity of heart sit downe and turne into the same light, and waite in the Spirit, and then ye are stronger: One in the Truth is strong, two in the Truth is stronger then one, and so all the rest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, in the feare of the Lord, sitting down
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206382:10"/>in pure stillnesse and silence, waiting in the light, a few that are thus gathered by the Arme of the Lord, into the unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this is a sweet and precious meeting, where all meet with the Lord, and being thus set waiting together, if any good thing move or stir in any it will be felt and heard throughout the whole meeting, if a pure sigh or groane, it will preach and draw inward to the watch, and so as all minds are stayed on the Lord in spirit, is refreshment to the soul, words which are precious, sweet and good; as the streame is sweet, so is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for if words be good (as it is confest by most sorts of people, and that to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to speake words is good, to edifie one another, but to meet in silence many doe not know what to think or make of it; Now I say that words in their place and season as they are spoken from the movings of love and life, are good and serviceable, but all words which are spoken in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and dead forme, though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so good words, if they doe not spring and arise from the good word, they are vaine and unprofitable, but words spoken in and from the life and Spirit of God, are good and profitable for the stirring up of the pure mind, then if words be good) the Spirit from which good words are spoken must needs be better; so then those who are brought to a pure still waiting upon God in the Spirit,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:206382:10"/>are come more nearer to the Lord tben words are, for God is a Spirit, and in the Spirit is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e worshipped, so that my soule hath deare union with you, who purely waite upon God in the Spirit, though never a word be spoken, to the hearing of the outward eare, yet in the spirit of love, I have unity with you, and here is the true feeding, in the spirit, and all who thus meet together to waite upon the Lord, shall renew their strength dayly, and in such a meeting where the presence and power of God is seen and felt, there will be an unwillingnesse to part asunder, being ready to say in your selves, it is good to be here, and this is the end of all words and writings, to bring people to the eternall liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Word. So all deare hearts, when ye come together to waite upon God, come sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly, and purely, that your meeting may be for the better, and not for the worse.</p>
            <p>And if any be moved to speake words, waite low in the pure feare to know the mind of the Spirit, where, and to whom, they are to be spoken, for a multitude of words in one particular meeting, to one and the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will burden the Seed, and bring dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; therefore if any be moved to speak, see that they speak in the power, and when the power is still, be ye still, for in the house of God amongst the family there will be little need; But if thou hast skill, goe and cast thy net into the Sea, and gather as many as thou
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:206382:11"/>canst, good and bad, out of the Sea, and they may be separated, the good from the bad afterwards.</p>
            <p>And all who speak of the moving of the Lord, I lay it as a charge upon you, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of abusing the power of God, in acting a wrong thing under pretence of being moved of the Lord, for the pure power may move (and then the enemy who goeth about like a roaring Lion seeking whom he may devour, he presents a wrong thing to the view of the understanding, and here is danger of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the power, acting that which the true power condemns, and yet pretends the power moves to it (and this is a double sin) as to bring forth a Bastard is a sin, but to father it upon an honest man who is not guilty of that sin, is a double sin; so to act any thing that the true power condemns is evill, but to father the evill upon the power is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evill.) Therefore let every one patiently waite, and not be hasty to run in the darke, but keep low in the true feare, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding may be opened, to know the mind of the Spirit, and then as the spirit moves, and leads, it is good to follow its leadings, for such are lead into all Truth; and thus my Friends, as you keep close to the Lord, and to the guidance of his good Spirit, you shall not doe amisse, but in all your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and performances, in the Worship of God, ye shall be a good savour unto the Lord,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:206382:11"/>and the Lord will accept of your services, and blesse and honour your Assemblies, with his presence and power.</p>
            <p>And now for the ordering of your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations amongst men, ye are to walke by the same Rule, that is, when your meeting is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doe not look upon the service of God to be ended, but keepe in the feare of God, that ye may receive Wisdome from God, to order the creatures, that the pure light may exercise your conscience towards God and men.</p>
            <p>A time there was at your first convincement, when ye stood in the crosse, to the worlds spirits, and could not conforme to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes; many of them have stood off for a time, and would not Trade nor deale with Friends, but when they see your fidellity, and honesty, they come againe, and many have greater desires to deale with Friends, then many of their own Generation, because they know that ye will not wrong them, nor deale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully with them, and then the blessing of God attends the faithfull, and gives an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, both inward and outward, then is the danger of being lifted up in mind, or drawne backe againe into the earth, so that the earth comes over, that will choake, and hinder the growth of the Seed, but as every one keeps in the dominion and power of God, so that the earth is his footstool, then the blessing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as love to the Truth is continued; and so deare Friends in all companies at all times
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:206382:12"/>and seasons, so walke that ye may be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good unto all, and answer the Witness of God in all, that God over all may be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you by his power daily kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in holinesse, and righteousnesse, out of the Worlds wickednesse, not for a day, or a weeke, or a certaine time only, but even all the dayes of your lives, for this is but just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that we should yield our members ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto God, who gives us life and strength, and all other good things; glory, and holy praises be rendred unto him, of all that knows him, for evermore.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, Deare Friends, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these present overturnings, and these great destractions, devisions, and confusions, in this our Nation, be not ye troubled nor shaken in mind, because of these things, there is a secret hand working in and through all these over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings; and they come to passe not without the knowledge of the Lord, for making way for greater things, which the Lord hath to bring to passe in this Nation, for much is yet to be throwne downe, before Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse be set up: My advice and counsell is, that every one of you, who love and beleeve in the light, be still and quiet, and side not with any parties, but own and cherish the good where ever it appears, and testifie against the evill in all, where ever it appears, not like the children of this World, warring with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weapons against flesh and blood to destroy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:206382:12"/>mens lives, but like Christians, with spirituall weapons warring against spirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and against all sinfull and fleshly lusts, which warre against the soul, not striking at creatures but at the power, that captivates the creatures, that so the creatures may be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God; so be not ye overcome with evill, but overcome evill with good, so shall you have peace with God, and true unity with all who are of God; the God of power strengthen you in every good word and worke, and perfect his worke in you, to his glory, who is blessed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
